# Calculator
version v1.0
  - basic ui
  - not very pretty
  - can only calculate 1 digits at a time
  - pretty ugly matematical problem showing, no operators shown
  - the result was shown in the problem area
 
version v2.0
  - prettied the problem showing, now it shows as a 1+1, not as 1,1 0
  - the result now shows in the place of the problem area
  - now can calculate very big numbers ( maybe can use doubles instead of ints)
  
 version v3.0
  - prettied the buttons
  - all of them look the same size
  - added division option
